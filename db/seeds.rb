# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
#
# user1 = User.create(name:"Chris")
# user2 = User.create(name:"Hamza")
# user3 = User.create(name:"Marc")
#
# reservation1 = Reservation.create(number_of_guests:2)
# reservation2 = Reservation.create(number_of_guests:4)
# reservation3 = Reservation.create(number_of_guests:1)
